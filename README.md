# GNU Basic Calculator (bc) Functions

My working file of functions for 
[GNU bc](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/).

## Functions

Here is a list of _all_ the functions this file defines:

[`sgn`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function)
[`abs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value)
[`heavyside`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function)
[`int`]()
[`ln`]()
[`log`]()
[`logb`]()
[`pow`]()
[`radtodeg`]()
[`degtorad`]()
[`cos`]()
[`sin`]()
[`tan`]()
[`sec`]()
[`csc`]()
[`cot`]()
[`arccos`]()
[`arcsin`]()
[`arctan`]()
[`atan2`]()
[`arcsec`]()
[`arccsc`]()
[`arccot`]()
[`cosh`]()
[`sinh`]()
[`tanh`]()
[`sech`]()
[`csch`]()
[`coth`]()
[`pythagtriple`]()
[`factorial`]()
[`pick`]()
[`choose`]()
[`fibonacci`]()
[`newton`]()
[`newtoniter`]()
[`integrate`]()
[`quadratic`]()
[`rational`]()

Alongside the ubiquitous mathematical functions in this list,
this file contains implementations of the following
more novel functions:

  - [Newton's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method)
    (`newton`)
    which approximates a zero of a smooth function.
  - [Boole's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boole's_rule)
    (`boole_` called by `integrate`)
    which numerically computes the value of a definite integral.
  - [Pythagorean Triple Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Generating_a_triple)
    (`pythagtriple`)
    which prints the Pythagorean triple generated by two parameters.
  - [Rational Approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction#Infinite_continued_fractions_and_convergents) 
    (`rational`)
    which approximates a number by a rational convergent 
    of its continued fraction.

## Conventions

  - Function names ending in `_` are *helper* functions,
    not intended to be called directly.
  - If a function changes/defines a variable globally, 
    the function must `print` that assignment.
    An exception to this is if the function defines an array
    that shares the same name as the function (e.g. `factorial`).
  - Since bc doesn't accept functions as parameters to other functions,
    any functions that morally should be a parameter must be defined globally.
    Such a function is named `f`. If there must be two functions,
    the other will be named `g`. If a function wants to know the derivative of `f`,
    it'll expect that derivative to be named `ff` (see `newton` for example).

## Aspirations

  - Remove the `n` parameter to `rational`
  - Improve numerical integral function by removing `n`
  - Add `cubic` and `quartic` functions
    that prints the roots of a cubic polynomial or quartic polynomial
  - Add a prime factorization function
  - Add a function that finds "algebraic" approximations to real numbers. (see [this](https://mathoverflow.net/q/2861/64073))
  - Add a numerical derivative function (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-point_stencil))
  - Bernoulli numbers and polynomials
  - Euclidean algorithm for the GCD (add to exercises)
